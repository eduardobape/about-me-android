    I remember the time when I saw Android for the first time on an online blog. It was Android 1.6.
    At that moment I said that this Operating System was going to be awesome and widely spread.
    Then I owned a traditional phone with a super small color screen, not a smartphone. It was a
    Sony Ericsson T610.
    It is awesome how much phones have been improved since then, becoming better and better.
    From about four year ago, I decided to become an Android developer.
    I had been programming in Python for the last two years before this, but when I had the opportunity
    to change to Android I did not doubt it.
    I had already been programming in Java for web and desktop apps, but Android was a completely
    different world for me.
    As the years went by, I started to realize that Java was not the perfect programming language for
    Android. It seemed a language which was not fit with a platform evolving so fast.
    Furthermore, I started to be tired of this language and the way it forced me to program.
    Everything became worse when I realized that Android was not going to support many modern features
    of the upcoming Java versions like Java 8 or 11.
    Suddenly, Google gave us good news. Kotlin was going to be the first language for Android.
    Kotlin and Jetpack libraries have given a boost to Android development. Both have given me back
    the enthusiasm to develop great apps for Android platform.</string>
